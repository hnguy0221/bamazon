# bamazon

Hello,

My name is Hai Nguyen. I created this application as part of the homework assignment for the Full Stack Web Development class I am taking at the University of Denver. It is an application that works like you purchase stuff from the Amazon. It is written in Node JavaScript and it uses Inquirer to prompt the user for inputs and MySql database to store the data. It consists of three pieces:

1. bamazonCustomer.js - This application will take in orders from customers and update the store's inventory. When it is first run, it will display a menu of two options:
* Purchase Products
* Exit

When the user selects option, Purchase Products, a list of products will be displayed. The user then can select whatever product they would like to purchase and how many. 

The application then updates the store's inventory and prints out the total cost.

If the user select option, 'Exit', it will exit the program.

2. bamazonManager.js - This application 
3. bamazonSupervisor.js - This application
